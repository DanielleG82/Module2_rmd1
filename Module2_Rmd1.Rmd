This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](https://www.google.com/)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```


Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice


Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice


Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.


Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested


Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))





When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure1, fig.height=3, fig.width=3, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```

## Insert equation (using LaTex)

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$

## Insert images

Here is an inserted image

![Sunstar](sunstar.png)

Here is the R logo (using a link only works if you knit to html, not word, not pdf)

![r logo](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)


## Insert an animated GIF and video (only works in html)

![sunstar_gif](sunstar.gif)
![sunstar_mp4](sunstar.mp4)

## Footnote
# Method 1: annotation with index number. At the end of the document, provide the content you want displayed (doesn't work for me!)
# Method 2: inline note. dont have to add at the end

Here is a footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inlines notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

Content to be referenced:
[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
